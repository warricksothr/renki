## Description

`attack` (7.2): melee or ranged against an entity, with blocking and dodging, behind Safety.AllowCombat. Fails with target_lost when the target is gone, and stops on the dead-man rule like every body task.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] attack fights an entity until it dies or the task is stopped
- [ ] It blocks and dodges, and is refused unless AllowCombat is on
