## Description

Scene 2 of the M2 benchmark. On "go chop wood", the bot chooses where: the most recent work site it remembers for this world, or else the nearest trees in memory and perception within a sensible distance of home. It carries out harvest on tree, then the log halves, then the stumps if worth it, collects the wood, and hauls it home as the hauling routine does when full. It stops when told, when it has no axe, or when it has hauled a set amount.

No-chop zones (places to leave alone) come later and are filed separately; the choice of site should leave room for them.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Told to chop wood, the bot goes to the last work site, or else the nearest trees it knows
- [ ] It fells, splits and collects, and hauls home when full
- [ ] It says why it cannot (no axe, no trees known) and stops when told

## Notes

**agent:claude-code/renki-groom** at 2026-10-29T03:40:56Z

2026-10-28: build this as a gather template on the behaviour engine (TKT-01M62VXYSN4, 'Controller: behaviour engine: templates, instances, triggers, repeat'), so 'go chop wood' starts an instance with an until condition, and stock targets (TKT-01M62VXZF8N7) or the agent can start it too.
