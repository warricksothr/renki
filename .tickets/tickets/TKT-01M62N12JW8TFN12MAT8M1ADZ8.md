## Description

Scene 2 of the M2 benchmark. On "go chop wood", the bot chooses where: the most recent work site it remembers for this world, or else the nearest trees in memory and perception within a sensible distance of home. It carries out harvest on tree, then the log halves, then the stumps if worth it, collects the wood, and hauls it home as the hauling routine does when full. It stops when told, when it has no axe, or when it has hauled a set amount.

No-chop zones (places to leave alone) come later and are filed separately; the choice of site should leave room for them.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Told to chop wood, the bot goes to the last work site, or else the nearest trees it knows
- [ ] It fells, splits and collects, and hauls home when full
- [ ] It says why it cannot (no axe, no trees known) and stops when told

## Implementation plan

Continue the owner's autonomous M2 request with a bounded gather template on the existing behavior engine. First slice: one explicit world/site (radius<=40m), one isolated tier-zero full beech, then newly observed nearby beech logs, with at most five native harvest tasks/eight minutes. Native C# retains approach/strike/falling escape/collection ownership; the controller only chooses subsequent resources. Initial IDs exclude pre-existing logs and proximity is not claimed as spawn lineage. Require active food, healthy dry footing, usable carried axe, capacity reserve, fresh perception/inventory, matching successful tasks and final observed Wood gain. Preserve baseline product counts, stow only gains through the existing task-receipt runner into explicit ordered chests, optionally return to the site. Failed/unsafe/unavailable descendant logs stop rather than moving to another tree. Owner stop, permissions, disconnect and world changes retain engine revocation semantics. No default background job is enabled.

Validate sequencing through log halves, stale observations, unrelated/old logs, unsafe characters/structures, tool/capacity/health guards, bounded targets/time, measured gain and baseline-preserving deposit/return. Run focused behavior checks, CI, committed review and deploy. Keep chat-driven site inference, remembered owner work sites, continuous hauling and all unearned compound acceptance criteria open. The just vm harvest-trial benchmark remains the autonomous low-level game check; a controller-level gathering/delivery check requires a safe known site/chest route and must not be represented as passed from component tests alone.

## Notes

**agent:claude-code/renki-groom** at 2026-10-29T03:40:56Z

2026-10-28: build this as a gather template on the behaviour engine (TKT-01M62VXYSN4, 'Controller: behaviour engine: templates, instances, triggers, repeat'), so 'go chop wood' starts an instance with an until condition, and stock targets (TKT-01M62VXZF8N7) or the agent can start it too.

Implemented bounded gather template: explicit world/site and ordered destination chests; one full tier-zero beech, then only new nearby beech logs; five harvest targets/eight-minute bound; native harvest owns movement/aim/swing/escape/collection. Requires fresh target removal and inventory after native success, at least two log harvests and measured Wood gain before stow. Existing product counts are preserved and only gained Wood/BeechSeeds/Resin/Feathers enter the task-receipt-based stow runner, optionally returning to the site. No default instance is enabled. Unavailable descendants stop the chain rather than selecting another tree.

Focused just check controller test-packages ./internal/behaviour ./internal/app ./internal/session passed (.checks/20261030T063331Z-UJ1mbC.log); subsequent health-loss/food-decay and pre-travel-character guards passed focused behavior checks (.checks/20261030T063553Z-VCsbxg.log). Tests cover complete tree/log/halves/deposit/return, old-log exclusion, preservation of original inventory, unsafe/unavailable descendants, stale success observations, weight measured from current inventory, tools/food/health/stamina/scope/time/target bounds and owner takeover preventing later steps. Final CI/review/landing/deployment follow. Controller-level gathering/delivery, site inference, remembered owner work sites, continuous multi-tree hauling and chat start/stop remain unverified or unimplemented; all broad AC stay open.

PR #64 merged as67e2e1e; bounded gather is installed in cd08433. Final just check ci passed (.checks/20261030T063721Z-QwtwVM.log), committed just check review passed (.checks/20261030T063806Z-tbpNBn.log), and package checksums verified (.checks/20261030T064329Z-WRdP6W.log). No gather instance was installed or enabled. Deterministic tree/log/halves/gain-only-stow/return and owner-takeover checks pass. Controller-level live delivery, site inference, chat controls and repeated multi-tree hauling remain open; component harvesting success does not close these AC. Use docs/BEHAVIOURS.md for current parameters and bounds rather than rereading implementation history.
