## Description

Scene 2 of the M2 benchmark. On "go chop wood", the bot chooses where: the most recent work site it remembers for this world, or else the nearest trees in memory and perception within a sensible distance of home. It carries out harvest on tree, then the log halves, then the stumps if worth it, collects the wood, and hauls it home as the hauling routine does when full. It stops when told, when it has no axe, or when it has hauled a set amount.

No-chop zones (places to leave alone) come later and are filed separately; the choice of site should leave room for them.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Told to chop wood, the bot goes to the last work site, or else the nearest trees it knows
- [ ] It fells, splits and collects, and hauls home when full
- [ ] It says why it cannot (no axe, no trees known) and stops when told

## Implementation plan

Add owner-authorized deterministic chop wood/gather wood chat commands that queue the existing bounded controller gather template. Use fresh scoped state/perception/inventory, existing tool/food/health/capacity/character guards and explicit permissions before saving or starting anything. Prefer the previous command's persisted same-world worksite when fresh safe trees confirm it, or use a distant remembered site as a travel hint that must be revalidated on arrival; otherwise choose a nearby currently observed isolated beech with danger-aware cost. Choose ordered remembered/current home chests as hints, retaining exact native storage receipts. Persist one identifiable manual once-only command instance; refuse collisions with user-authored instances, active tasks and queued work. Normal stop/owner takeover must cancel without later steps. Verify planner refusals, permission/chat routing, persisted-site reuse and cancellation; run focused checks, CI and committed review. Keep full live delivery, repeated hauling and M3 kill/block/dodge acceptance open. The protected-tree live refusal from the benchmark is retained; do not ask for owner staging or rerun unchanged.

## Notes

**agent:claude-code/renki-groom** at 2026-10-29T03:40:56Z

2026-10-28: build this as a gather template on the behaviour engine (TKT-01M62VXYSN4, 'Controller: behaviour engine: templates, instances, triggers, repeat'), so 'go chop wood' starts an instance with an until condition, and stock targets (TKT-01M62VXZF8N7) or the agent can start it too.

**agent:codex/renki-resume** at 2026-10-30T06:37:20Z

Implemented bounded gather template: explicit world/site and ordered destination chests; one full tier-zero beech, then only new nearby beech logs; five harvest targets/eight-minute bound; native harvest owns movement/aim/swing/escape/collection. Requires fresh target removal and inventory after native success, at least two log harvests and measured Wood gain before stow. Existing product counts are preserved and only gained Wood/BeechSeeds/Resin/Feathers enter the task-receipt-based stow runner, optionally returning to the site. No default instance is enabled. Unavailable descendants stop the chain rather than selecting another tree.

Focused just check controller test-packages ./internal/behaviour ./internal/app ./internal/session passed (.checks/20261030T063331Z-UJ1mbC.log); subsequent health-loss/food-decay and pre-travel-character guards passed focused behavior checks (.checks/20261030T063553Z-VCsbxg.log). Tests cover complete tree/log/halves/deposit/return, old-log exclusion, preservation of original inventory, unsafe/unavailable descendants, stale success observations, weight measured from current inventory, tools/food/health/stamina/scope/time/target bounds and owner takeover preventing later steps. Final CI/review/landing/deployment follow. Controller-level gathering/delivery, site inference, remembered owner work sites, continuous multi-tree hauling and chat start/stop remain unverified or unimplemented; all broad AC stay open.

PR #64 merged as67e2e1e; bounded gather is installed in cd08433. Final just check ci passed (.checks/20261030T063721Z-QwtwVM.log), committed just check review passed (.checks/20261030T063806Z-tbpNBn.log), and package checksums verified (.checks/20261030T064329Z-WRdP6W.log). No gather instance was installed or enabled. Deterministic tree/log/halves/gain-only-stow/return and owner-takeover checks pass. Controller-level live delivery, site inference, chat controls and repeated multi-tree hauling remain open; component harvesting success does not close these AC. Use docs/BEHAVIOURS.md for current parameters and bounds rather than rereading implementation history.

PR #96 merged the broad-site approach regression/fix. Focused behavior checks, just check ci (.checks/20261030T185100Z-mTlVk9.log) and committed just check review (.checks/20261030T185134Z-uPodSM.log) passed. Deployed in 635f4e9 and retained in installed 5a5f5c9; checksum-verified installation .checks/20261030T190549Z-IPaAzz.log. Full controller tree -> logs -> gain-only chest receipt -> return proof remains open, along with site inference/chat and repeated hauling. The previous pending approach stash was removed only after its exact implementation landed.

**agent:codex/renki-milestones** at 2026-10-30T20:22:23Z

Added a controller-owned gather benchmark with exact instance/native step attribution, distinct tree/new-log break proof, measured gain-only chest receipts, preserved starting products and return-site pose/task verification. Supervisor checks cover lost behavior-save responses, bad/missing audit proof, damage between polls and cleanup failure; temporary definitions are stopped/deleted and the game is stopped with combat off and offline panel online. Compact trial-status now finds gather runs and tolerates missing terminal results.

First live attempt against installed a525b18 aborted before any task: no isolated full beech in the native selector's 18 m radius. .checks/gather-trial-20261030T201912076800Z/summary.json and .checks/20261030T201912Z-pBuX0o.log retain evidence. No damage events, no travel/work, final66.2/66.2 HP and successful cleanup. Detailed observations show nearest three trees11.9–13.7 m away were close to a Boar/structures; tree1:61548 was18.48 m away but only30.5 m from the Boar, still inside32 m falling protection. No currently observed full beech passed protection even when considering farther trees. This is a correct refusal, not gathering proof or an owner-clearance request.

The controller benchmark now considers observed sites up to60 m away because gather can approach before its18 m native acquisition; unchanged falling/character/structure guards remain authoritative. Bounded nearest-candidate diagnostics explain subsequent refusals without broad perception dumps. Focused benchmark/native regression checks passed; final CI/review follow. Full delivery, chat/site selection and repeated hauling remain open. Do not rerun the same protected site until a new safe-site acquisition strategy or changed observations justify it.

**agent:codex/renki-milestones** at 2026-10-30T20:31:03Z

Implemented owner/command-profile grammar go chop wood, chop wood and gather wood, routed to the existing controller gather template without model interpretation. The bounded command selects a safe observed tier-zero beech within60 m using remembered danger preferences, or reuses its persisted same-world site when freshly confirmed/distant enough to need travel and revalidation. Home/site remain within150 m of home; ordered storage hints are within10 m of home. Existing native safety, gain-only receipt-based stow and return remain authoritative. Missing prerequisites and active/queued work are explained before starting. One manual once-only Owner wood gathering instance stores the requested site and never resumes automatically after restart; a user-authored name collision is refused.

Focused behavior/chat/app checks passed: .checks/20261030T202955Z-Xx77CT.log. Coverage includes distant approach without relaxed protection, foreign/unsafe-local site exclusion, confirmed remembered-site preference, missing axe/food/capacity/stamina/home/storage/fresh perception, unauthorized chat, permission refusal, user-definition preservation, persisted non-resumption, queued owner stop and a newer stop arriving during planning. The latter binds the queued work to the original control revision so a settings save cannot resurrect an older order. A separate existing player-presence test timed out once in an earlier focused run; its targeted rerun and the subsequent full focused suites passed (.checks/20261030T202804Z-sTD8Ls.log and .checks/20261030T202909Z-tfOVFK.log). No presence change was made merely to hide that timeout.

Final CI/review/landing/deployment follow. All broad M2 AC remain unticked until required live proof is earned. This command is one bounded tree cycle, not repeated multi-tree hauling, mining or crafting. M3 positive kill/block/dodge proof also remains open.
