## Description

Scene 2 of the M2 benchmark. On "go chop wood", the bot chooses where: the most recent work site it remembers for this world, or else the nearest trees in memory and perception within a sensible distance of home. It carries out harvest on tree, then the log halves, then the stumps if worth it, collects the wood, and hauls it home as the hauling routine does when full. It stops when told, when it has no axe, or when it has hauled a set amount.

No-chop zones (places to leave alone) come later and are filed separately; the choice of site should leave room for them.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Told to chop wood, the bot goes to the last work site, or else the nearest trees it knows
- [ ] It fells, splits and collects, and hauls home when full
- [ ] It says why it cannot (no axe, no trees known) and stops when told

## Implementation plan

Continue the existing bounded gather-template plan and autonomous M2 benchmark. Code inspection found that entering a broad site radius marked arrival, even with central trees beyond the native 18 m acquisition radius. Approach within min(site radius, 12 m) of the explicit work point before choosing the first tree. Keep resource/worksite radius, supported native movement, permissions, food/tool/health/capacity guards, gains-only storage and optional return unchanged. Add a regression starting 25 m from the center inside a 30 m site, then verify movement precedes harvesting, plus preservation of smaller site radii. Run focused behavior checks, just check ci, committed just check review and deploy after the active resupply check. Then prepare the controller-level full-tree -> logs -> inventory gains -> chest receipt -> return-site benchmark. Site inference/chat commands and repeated hauling remain open; no acceptance criterion is earned merely from this approach fix.

## Notes

**agent:claude-code/renki-groom** at 2026-10-29T03:40:56Z

2026-10-28: build this as a gather template on the behaviour engine (TKT-01M62VXYSN4, 'Controller: behaviour engine: templates, instances, triggers, repeat'), so 'go chop wood' starts an instance with an until condition, and stock targets (TKT-01M62VXZF8N7) or the agent can start it too.

Implemented bounded gather template: explicit world/site and ordered destination chests; one full tier-zero beech, then only new nearby beech logs; five harvest targets/eight-minute bound; native harvest owns movement/aim/swing/escape/collection. Requires fresh target removal and inventory after native success, at least two log harvests and measured Wood gain before stow. Existing product counts are preserved and only gained Wood/BeechSeeds/Resin/Feathers enter the task-receipt-based stow runner, optionally returning to the site. No default instance is enabled. Unavailable descendants stop the chain rather than selecting another tree.

Focused just check controller test-packages ./internal/behaviour ./internal/app ./internal/session passed (.checks/20261030T063331Z-UJ1mbC.log); subsequent health-loss/food-decay and pre-travel-character guards passed focused behavior checks (.checks/20261030T063553Z-VCsbxg.log). Tests cover complete tree/log/halves/deposit/return, old-log exclusion, preservation of original inventory, unsafe/unavailable descendants, stale success observations, weight measured from current inventory, tools/food/health/stamina/scope/time/target bounds and owner takeover preventing later steps. Final CI/review/landing/deployment follow. Controller-level gathering/delivery, site inference, remembered owner work sites, continuous multi-tree hauling and chat start/stop remain unverified or unimplemented; all broad AC stay open.

PR #64 merged as67e2e1e; bounded gather is installed in cd08433. Final just check ci passed (.checks/20261030T063721Z-QwtwVM.log), committed just check review passed (.checks/20261030T063806Z-tbpNBn.log), and package checksums verified (.checks/20261030T064329Z-WRdP6W.log). No gather instance was installed or enabled. Deterministic tree/log/halves/gain-only-stow/return and owner-takeover checks pass. Controller-level live delivery, site inference, chat controls and repeated multi-tree hauling remain open; component harvesting success does not close these AC. Use docs/BEHAVIOURS.md for current parameters and bounds rather than rereading implementation history.
